<li><h3>APh 150. Quantum Measurement and Control</h3><p>9 units (3-0-6); Prerequisite: Ph 125 or equivalent. The class is intended as an in depth review of quantum measurement theory, and an introduction to the feedback and control of quantum systems. The course will also attempt to introduce the physics and applications of these ideas to quantum information processing and quantum metrology.  Instructor:   O. Painter.</p></li>
<li><h3>APh 150. Introduction to Quantum Devices</h3><p>9 units (3-0-6); Prerequisite: Ph 12 or equivalent. This class is meant to be an introduction to the quantum technologies currently being developed for the processing and communication of quantum information.  Topics covered will include a primer on quantum computation (qubits, quantum gates, Shor's algorithm, etc.) and quantum-limited measurement (shot noise, quantum-limited amplifiers, weak measurement, decoherence, etc.), atomic quantum optical memories, optomechanics, color centers, superconducting quantum circuits, and quantum plasmonics.  Instructor:   O. Painter (with guest lectures).</p></li>
<li><h3>APh 190 abc. Quantum Electronics.</h3><p>9 units (3-0-6); Prerequisite: Ph 125 or equivalent. Generation, manipulations, propagation, and applications of coherent radiation. The basic theory of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with resonant atomic transitions. Laser oscillation, important laser media, Gaussian beam modes, the electro-optic effect, nonlinear-optics theory, second harmonic generation, parametric oscillation, stimulated Brillouin and Raman scattering. Other topics include quantum optical states of the electromagnetic field, theory of open quantum systems, balanced homodyne detection and quantum measurement of light, quantum noise, linear amplifier theory, quantum non-demolition and back-action evading measurements, light modulation, diffraction of light by sound, integrated optics, and phase conjugate optics.
